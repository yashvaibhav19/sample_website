            Hi people. Its day 8 of me trying to get my hands dirty with web development. To be really honest with you'll, I am having fun doing this. A part of me feels guilty for it. For quitting on competitive programming. Deep down I am conflicted about putting efforts into something I like vs putting efforts into something thatcan secure my job. Wow. Melancholy ensues. Maybe someday I will accept that it wasn't for me and I am better off practising something more worthwhile. But I so deeply wish for a redemption story. A blogpost on codeforces whose title would be "For an year I struggled to get green and now that I am Red.."
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;I guess we will have to wait and see, where this roller coaster ride takes me. I wish to improve. I have fallen down, its just about time I get back on my own two feet.
        </p>
